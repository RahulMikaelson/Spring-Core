### Explanation (Loose Coupling)

To run GameRunner we need an object of a game class. but now we have made an interface and that interface is implemented by both MarioGame and PackMan Game  and we made GameRunner class to be dependent on the Interface so that we have to pass any of the game class still it will be working as expected in this way we have achieved loose coupling.
